Commsor is a community management and analytics tool that provides a data driven way to grow, engage and measure community efforts.

As the first design hire, I was tasked with designing the Slack and GitHub analytics integrations. This was a highly user-requested feature, so I spent some time with pilot users to get an understanding of what a community manager, a salesperson, and a chief marketing officer would each need.
