I spent a summer as a product management intern on the [MVISION Cloud](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-cloud.html) team, which builds tools to provide data security for the cloud era.

Highlights include:

* Writing Product Requirement Documents
* Launching policy evaluator that helps businesses make writing and testing cloud access security policies more efficient
* Introducing user research practices to my team
* Learning TypeScript and AngularJS
