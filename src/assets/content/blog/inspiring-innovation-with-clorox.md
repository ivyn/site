For this project, our team designed an internal-facing website that allows Clorox employees to feel the spirit of innovation by learning about experiments that the innovation team is working on and submitting their own ideas.

We learned that employees were unaware of the innovation team and felt incentivized to contribute ideas by recognition and success stories.

This site serves as a hub where employees can get to know the innovation team, read blog posts about the latest technology in the industry, submit an experiment, and look at ongoing experiments.
