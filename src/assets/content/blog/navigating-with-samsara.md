As a product design consultant, I worked with the Routes team to help long-haul truck drivers stay on track and take care of themselves on the road.

Highlights include:

* Navigation and truck stop-finding feature for long-haul truck drivers
* Integration with U.S. work hour regulation systems
* Interviewing truck drivers
* User research workshops and design critiques from the Routes team
