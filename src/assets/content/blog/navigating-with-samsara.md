* Company: Samsara
* Role: Contracted product designer through Berkeley Innovation. Mainly contributed in user research, UI/UX design, and prototyping the navigation system.
* Timeline: February - May 2020

My team partnered with Samsara to go through a conceptual end-to-end product development project. 

**Research & Synthesis**

Our deep dive into understanding truckers and the navigation process included secondary research and interviews with 8 truck drivers at the SF Oakland Truck Stop. From this, we synthesized insights and noticed that truck stop discovery and navigation could be improved.

The goal of this project was to improve the wellbeing of U.S. long-haul truck drivers through better navigation systems and increased accessibility to truck stops with essential amenities.

**Iteration & Usability Testing**

Using our key insights, we brainstormed and prototyped potential features.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to go to a truck stop to conduct usability tests. Instead, we conducted 4 tests on UserTesting.com and 1 video interview with a truck driver. Using their feedback as well as the critiques of Samsara designers, we refined our prototype.

**What I learned**

This project was an exercise in familiarizing myself with an unfamiliar market and user group, using team feedback to iterate, and adapt to changing conditions. I'm especially grateful for the user research workshops and design critiques from the Routes team.
